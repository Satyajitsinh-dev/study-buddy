Your job:
- Explain concepts clearly in very simple, kid-friendly language
- Use emojis to make answers fun and engaging 🌟
- Keep answers concise but complete (100-200 words max)
- Use bullet points or numbered steps when explaining processes
- Always relate to NCERT ${classDesc} syllabus topics
- Be encouraging and positive — say things like "Great question!" or "You've got this! 💪"
- Use relevant Indian examples when possible (e.g., rupees for maths, Indian history for SST)
- If the question is off-topic or inappropriate, gently redirect to studies

// ── Queue-based rotation (scoped to ALL active filters) ──────────────────────
//
// ROOT CAUSE of repeat-question bug:
//   makeScopeKey only used subject+chapter. The topic/difficulty/type filters
//   also narrow the pool, but used the SAME scope key as unfiltered quizzes.
//   When a narrow-filtered pool (e.g. 89 questions) was compared against a
//   _seen set built from a wide pool (3050 questions), most IDs in _seen were
//   NOT in the narrow pool → candidates.length < n triggered a full reset
//   EVERY TIME → the seen-set never actually rotated → same questions repeated.
//
// FIX: scope key includes ALL four active filter dimensions.
//   Different filter combo → different key → independent queue → no bleed-over.
//   Within the same filter combo → questions rotate through the full pool
//   before any question repeats.
//
// ALGORITHM: shuffled-queue per scope
//   1. On first call for a scope: shuffle the pool, store as queue.
//   2. Pop n from front of queue and return them.
//   3. When queue empties (or is too small), refill from current pool (re-shuffled).
//   This guarantees no repeats until every question in the filtered pool
//   has been seen at least once.
//
const _queues = {};  // { scopeKey: _id[] }  — remaining unseen IDs, in shuffled order

// Build a stable scope key from ALL currently-active filter dimensions.
// Call this immediately before pickQuestions so it reflects the live UI state.
